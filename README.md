Since the CPU type may be different, so router , link_cost, pkt_HELLO, pkt_INIT, pkt_LSPDU and circuit_DB must be compiled.

To run router, do the following:

run "make"

then router , link_cost, pkt_HELLO, pkt_INIT, pkt_LSPDU and circuit_DB will be compiled
Open one terminal

run "./nse-linux386 <address> <port1>

Open the number of routers terminals

run "java router <address> <port1> <port n>" on each terminal

then you can see the reversed message
